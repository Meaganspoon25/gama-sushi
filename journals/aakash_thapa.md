02/27/2024 Conducted our first standup. I decided to work on authentication together. We created our GitLab repo for our project together. Meagan became the admin and the rest of us were assigned developers roles. Later, we changed every one of us as owners so everyone can push and merge. We also added an instructor as owner. 

02/28/2024 We created our first issue which was of course authentication. We started working and we were able to set up a few things. Figured out how to do migrations and see changes as well as see the updated database.
