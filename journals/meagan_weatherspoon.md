Conducted our very first standup as a team. I became the admin for our project on Gitlab. I made a mistake by putting my teammates as developers but I changed it to owners. The instructors were also added as owners to view our work.

Worked on designing the career page. Used a lot of API generator photos for the background.
03/18/2024
Added extra components to the homepage based off our excalidraw. I need to make the home page look more presentable. I’m struggling on how I actually want the page to look or make it pop. Managed to look up additional API photos for the background of the contact us page.

I had a tough time with the homepage but I’m slowly increasing my skills with css styling. I added a lot of borders and changed out a few images. I also changed the slider to automatic instead of just manual. So now the slider is both components.
03/20/2024
Changed a lot of things on the homepage using css. It looks much better than before. For my stretch goals, I want to become more creative and skilled using css components.
