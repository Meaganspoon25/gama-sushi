02/27/2024 Conducted our first standup. We decided to work on authentication together. We created our GitLab repo for our project together. Meagan became the admin and the rest of us were assigned developers roles. Later, we changed every one of us as owners so everyone can push and merge. We also added an instructor as owner.

02/28/2024 We created our first issue which was of course authentication. We started working and we were able to set up a few things. Figured out how to do migrations and see changes as well as see the updated database.

02/29/2024 Finished authentication and then did git push/merge. Learned how to create git merge and conduct test. Also installed flake8 in the project. Added flake8 extension in VScode. Lots of debugging and learning.

03/01/2024 Discussed journal and decided to push it towards the end of project. Created Issues for all endpoints. Divided work equally among each developer. Updated the wireframe with new insights.

03/04/2024 Made progress with endpoints for Reviews, Giftcards, Gallery and Cart. Learned how to connect user_id from accounts table to other tables

03/05/2024 Solved the issue with Pexels API endpoints. Learned how to import keys for API and where to place it. Decided to do frontend on location.

03/06/2024 Tested various keyword inputs in FastAPI to ensure that the output redirected to the pexels image URL. Once it did that then I moved on to assisting others with their endpoints.

03/07/2024 Began planning the front-end, and how to split up the work for that. Megan and I took the responsibility of starting the navbar, while Aakash and Gary took on the footer.

03/11/2024 Continued to work on the navbar, adding our routes to our menu, gallery, our vision, reviews, and checkout pages. We added blank pages as placeholders for later.

03/12/2024 Finished the navbar and footer, and began to plan out how our hero section would look. We referenced our excalidraw wireframe a lot, which already had a great design for how to approach it.

03/13/2024 We delegated tasks for one another to work on the front-end. I began to work on the gallery page, which required me to use the PEXELS API endpoint created in the back-end.

03/14/2024 I spent the majority of the day working through the API in order to display images in our gallery from Pexels. This was a challenge, so it was taking me quite some time. I hope to finish before the end of the week.

03/15/2024 While my teammates were working on their own tasks, I had still been developing the logic for the Gallery. I referenced previous projects (i.e., Conference GO) and was reading the Pexels documentation for help.

03/18/2024 After working on it a bit more throughout the weekend, I felt as though I had enough correct logic in my code, but I was stuck on one small problem that I couldn't figure out. In the meantime, I started working on my menu page - thinking of food item names and finding pictures for it.

03/19/2024 I got all of the menu items and names sorted, and the pictures as well. I spent the majority of the day formatting the listed appetizers + soup and noodles at the top of the page, followed by Sushi and Rolls (and their respective images) at the bottom. Next thing to add would be the names under each picture to show what they are.

03/20/2024 I asked the SEIRs for some help to look through my gallery logic, and while explaining the problem, we figured out the error in our code which was very simple. It was trying to pull a request directly from my backend using [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) instead of [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (which is the one for our front-end). Once I changed it, the images started appearing.

I spent the majority of my day styling the menu and the gallery afterwards.

03/21/2024 Today I spent a lot of time finishing up styling, replacing bad pictures and adding better ones, and making it more aesthetically pleasing. I touched up my "Our vision" page as well, adding the text components to it, and also restyling the images to make it look much better visually.

03/22/2024 Spent the majority of classtime working alongside my group to prepare for deployment, finalizing the readme, and testing the features on our website.
